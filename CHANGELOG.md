## v0.9.0 RC9 (6-9-2025)
* [plugin] Ensure buffers are cleared after plugin is opened. There was an issue in Reaper, and quite possibly in other hosts too, where right after opening VMPC2000XL, the multi-channel tracks were muted because the signal contained absurdly high amplitude values. This happens if a buffer is not properly cleared. This bug is now fixed.

## v0.9.0 RC8 (3-9-2025)
* [plugin] Implement musical position synchronization to the DAW. Wherever you place the play head in your DAW, VMPC2000XL positions its internal sequencer reasonably. Most likely this only works as expected if VMPC2000XL uses the same time signature as the DAW, and neither VMPC2000XL or the DAW vary the time signature anywhere in the arrangement.
* [plugin] The DAW's play head can be repositioned while playing, and VMPC2000XL follows.
* [plugin] Fix synchronization with Cubase. In earlier versions of VMPC2000XL this wasn't working at all.
* [plugin] VMPC2000XL now also supports synchronizing to the DAW in Song mode.
* [standalone] Fix individual outputs. v0.9.0.0 introduced a regression due to the complete rewrite of multibus support. This has been fixed.
* Fix conflict between ordinary typing and typing via the pads in the Name screen.
* Make ordinary typing configurable. See Shift + 0 for VMPC2000XL-specific settings. If `Name typing w. keybd` is set to `NO`, you can only enter names via the cursor keys and DATA wheel, or via the pads.
* Fix small cosmetic bug when using the slider in the `TRIM` screen to change the `End` value.
* Hide unused fields in the timestretch functionality. Timestretch in VMPC2000XL isn't nearly as good and complete as the MPC2000XL's timestretch, in particular because it doesn't implement the `Preset` and `Adjust` fields. Previously, VMPC2000XL was showing these fields, even though they are ignored by the timestretch algorithm. This is very misleading, and it probably has wasted precious time of users who would keep trying to timestretch with different settings that didn't actually make a difference in the result.
* Allow the `Open Window` key to close the opened window, just like on the real MPC2000XL.

## v0.9.0 RC4 (29-7-2025)
* Fix slider UI updates when moving the slider via MIDI.
* Fix Song mode DAW synchronization.
* In the Mixer screens, holding down SHIFT and tapping the drum pads, allows you to select multiple channels simultaneously. This is an official MPC2000XL feature that was missing all these years.
* Fix various multi-bus issues with the VST3 version. The issues were noticed in Reaper, but it's possible other hosts had issues too. The wrong audio was sent to the wrong bus, and after changing the individual output of a pad, there was noise in the buffer. Additionally in Reaper many of the additional buses would at times be muted after opening the plugin. Also the initial channel configuration in Reaper was incorrect.
* Follow DAW tempo, even when the DAW is not playing.
* Fix iOS Bluetooth MIDI permissions.
* Show the disclaimer only once. It was showing every time you opened the GUI in some hosts for some plugin formats.

## v0.9.0 RC0 (28-2-2025)
* Completely new UI based on vector graphics
* Improved multi-bus plugin support
* LV2 for macOS and Windows

## v0.6.4 (24-10-2024)

* Fix various issues when using more than 127 sounds.
* Implement 256 sounds in memory limit. Before this, VMPC2000XL would allow over 256 sounds in memory at a time, which is incongruent and incompatible with the real MPC2000XL.
* Fix iOS keyboard configuration and learn (i.e. `Shift + 0` and then `F2` for `KEYBRD`).
* Fix sound and program name derivation. To summarize, the real MPC2000XL uses the sound or program name that is encoded in the actual the file data -- with mixed casing, like `CoolKick` or `NewPgm-A` -- if, and only if, the encoded name is a case-insensitive equivalent of the file name. If it's not, the file name becomes the sound or program name, resulting in upper casing, like `COOLKICK` or `NEWPGM-A`. VMPC2000XL now follows this behaviour.
* Minor cosmetic fixes in `KEYBRD`, `Copy Sound`, and `Channel Settings` screens.
* For developers: I'm learning Vim, so I've made some minor changes to facilitate working on VMPC2000XL in Vim. The main change is the creation of `compile_commands.json` during the CMake generation stage. The rest of my setup can be found [here](https://github.com/izzyreal/vim-config).

A special thank you to all the bug reporters on GitHub!

## v0.6.0 (15-6-2024)
* First public iOS TestFlight release: https://testflight.apple.com/join/yEgfYk21
* Allow typing tempo, bar/beat/clock, and velocity ratio in MAIN screen
* Do not ignore attack when dcy md is start
* Fix recording time when sampling
## v0.5.14.4 (29-1-2024)
* Fix crash when quickly and repeatedly previewing SND or WAV files in the LOAD or Directory screen.
* Implement Locate screen. This screen and its functionality, which is present on the real MPC2000XL, was simply not implemented in VMPC2000XL so far. Now it is. The locations are persisted to the ALL file as well.
* Fix various ALL-file persistence issues.
* Never rename `.DS_Store` file as part of making all files Akai-name compatible. This should avoid some garbage files accumulating in your MPC2000XL directory.
* Fix hanging clock after using pads to add notes via step editor.

## v0.5.14.3 (5-1-2024)
* Implement ALL file song first loop step, last loop step and loop enabled reading and writing.
* Fix loading songs from ALL files created by the real MPC2000XL.
* Fix previewing 24-bit WAV files and WAV files with non-fmt chunks before the fmt chunk via the PLAY function in the LOAD and Directory screens.

## v0.5.14.2 (31-12-2023)
* Fix song mode when running VMPC2000XL as a plugin.

## v0.5.14.1 (30-12-2023, macOS only)
* This macOS only release addresses an issue with asking for microphone/audio input permissions in the standalone version.

## v0.5.14 (29-12-2023, all systems except iPadOS)
* [plugin] Keep following the host tempo after loading TEST1 or TEST2 demo beats. VMPC2000XL uses the MIDI/SYNC input and output modes to determine whether to follow the host tempo and transport. These settings are stored in `.ALL` files, and therefor also in standalone auto-save and DAW project data. With this update, when you're running VMPC2000XL as a plugin, the MIDI/SYNC input and output modes are not changed when loading a `.ALL` file or restoring a DAW project.
* Fix 'Hold pads or keys to erase' while overdubbing.

## iPadOS build v0.5.13 (3) (28-12-2023)
* Better resizing in AUv3.
* [AUv3] Keep following the host tempo after loading TEST1 or TEST2 demo beats. See v0.5.14 above for more explanation.
* Fix 'Hold pads or keys to erase' while overdubbing.

## v0.5.13 (28-12-2023)
iPadOS specific improvements:
* AUv3 and Standalone now share the same documents (including imported samples).
* There's a share/export button. You can share the following things: APS, ALL and SND files of the active state, a selected (in the LOAD screen) file or directory, or a direct-to-disk recording (aka bounce). Directories and recordings are always zipped before sharing/exporting. There are many share destinations available: Save to Files, AirDrop, etc.
* There's a Recording Manager button (folder icon). It shows a list of direct-to-disk recordings, which you can play and delete.
* The standalone application can only be used in landscape orientation.
* iPhoneOS support has been dropped. The screen is too small for the current UI and there are no concrete plans to make a UI that is suitable for iOS devices that are smaller than the smallest iPad. So from now on the mentioning of iOS will be phased out in favor of iPadOS.

Please note that the VMPC2000XL folder that is located in "On My iPad" is not used anymore starting with this version (v0.5.13) of VMPC2000XL. Make sure any important files you have there are moved out, because in the next iPad release of VMPC2000XL this folder will be removed completely.

Generic improvements:
* Fixed a regression in direct-to-disk recording where the recording process would never start.
* Direct-to-disk recordings are now stored in a directory with a nice name with timestamp. They will not be overwritten anymore.
* Direct-to-disk recordings that are silent are automatically removed right after finishing recording.

## v0.5.12 (24-12-2023)
* Recording new sounds while your audio engine is running at a sample rate other than 44100 Hz was resulting in corrupted sounds and crashes. This is now fixed.

## v0.5.11 (18-12-2023)
* Improve plugin-to-host synchronization. You can now change the tempo in the host however you like, including big changes in tempo, for example from 30 to 300 BPM in an instant or other way around. It should work with any buffer size, as long as the host starts at the start of a bar. If you have a loop configured in the host, this should also work. You can also start playing in VMPC2000XL when the host is not playing.
* [macOS] VST3 on older macOS versions was not working due to an issue with the version of Xcode I was using for my builds. This is now fixed.

## v0.5.10 (15-12-2023)
* Fix plugin-to-host synchronization. The problem that was fixed in this version is that VMPC2000XL used to start playing too late. But note that at the moment tempo changes from the host are handled ok on the iPad version in AUM, but not in Ableton Live and possibly other DAWs. More investigation and improvements needed, so for now to keep VMPC2000XL in sync with the DAW use small buffer sizes (preferably 128 or lower), keep the tempo static, and start playing from the start of a bar. By the way, if you notice VMPC2000XL is not syncing to the host at all, check if you have MIDI clock enabled in the MIDI/SYNC screen (Shift + 9):

## v0.5.9 (5-12-2023)
* Fix tempo change bug when tempo source is master (shout out to playpm for reporting this bug)

## v0.5.8 (3-12-2023)
* Allow custom skins. See https://github.com/izzyreal/vmpc-juce/tree/master/resources/img for the original bitmaps. Place files with those file names in `~/Documents/VMPC2000XL/Skin` to override the originals. At the moment the background, slider and datawheel are skinnable. Let me know if you need anything else to be skinnable.
* Fixed an issue with Timing Correct. It was ignoring the note range.
* Support using the slider in the Zone screen, as well as in all the Fine screens. As usual, hold Shift while moving the slider to change Start, End or Loop To.
* Fixed unnecessary memory allocation.
* Optimized memory and disk usage while recording and previewing sounds, and when bouncing sequences and songs to disk.
* Support key repeats on Linux. Note that the delay and interval are hardcoded at 400ms and 25ms respectively.
* Added demo beats to Linux and iOS versions.
* Updated documentation: https://vmpcdocs.izmar.nl/ and https://vmpcdocs.izmar.nl/vmpc2000xl.pdf
* [internal] [Unit tests](https://github.com/izzyreal/mpc/tree/master/src/test) are now run in the CI/CD. Although we don't have that many unit tests, a bunch of important functionality that was historically fragile is now always tested before publishing a new release.
* Additional info regarding AU use in Logic: https://github.com/izzyreal/vmpc-juce/blob/master/plugin-compatibility-matrix.md

## v0.5.7 (3-10-2023)
* Fix a rare plugin crash related to MIDI handling after unloading and loading the plugin. Standalone was and still is unaffected by this issue.

## v0.5.6 (20-9-2023)
* Fix looping sounds. They resulted in hanging notes.

## v0.5.5 (19-9-2023)
* Fix insert bars and changing time signature. It was fine in trivial cases, but it corrupted the less trivial ones. It should now work properly. This was affecting the Convert Song to Seq functionality, which should now also be reliable.

## v0.5.4 (17-9-2023)
* Implement Convert Song to Seq (shout out to c3ntr0n800 for the reminder).
* Fix Erase window issue. It wasn't removing all the events that should be erased.

## v0.5.3.1 (23-8-2023, Linux only release)
Fixes Edit window | NORMALIZE. It was corrupting the sound due to my absentminded use of `abs` rather than `std::fabs`, `min` rather than `std::fmin` and same for `fmax`.

## v0.5.3 (19-8-2023)
* Fix sampling at 44.1KHz.
* Fix waveform display of right channel in TRIM, LOOP and ZONE screens.
* Fix waveform display in Linux (it was messing up the lower half).

## v0.5.2 (14-8-2023)
* Experimental skin feature: place `sliders.png`, `datawheels.png` or `bg.jpg` in `~/Documents/VMPC2000XL/Skin` to replace these assets with your own. The original assets can be found here: https://github.com/izzyreal/vmpc-juce/tree/master/resources/img.
* Lock `RECORD` or `OVERDUB` button by double-clicking with the mouse. Click once to unlock. This way you can make VMPC2000XL as a plugin start recording even when it's not in focus and when it's synced to the DAW.
* Smaller macOS installer and binaries by moving resource files out of the binary and placing them in the Resources directory in the Bundle.

## v0.5.1 (29-7-2023)
* Updated documentation: https://vmpcdocs.izmar.nl
* Documentation also [available in PDF](https://vmpcdocs.izmar.nl/vmpc2000xl.pdf).

* Note repeat MIDI output.
* Fix maximum number of audio output channels. It was limited to a single stereo pair.
* Fix 16-level note repeats.
* Improve step editor navigation (remember active field when you were last in that screen better).
* Playing events in the step editor now results in the correct duration.
* PURGE to remove all unused samples is now working correctly.
* Fix `~/Documents/VMPC2000XL/Volumes/MPC2000XL` file renaming on Windows. For example if you've copied a samplepack over, the names usually need to be shortened. This was messed up and now it's better.
* Load MIDI files that were exported from Ableton Live.
* Fix macOS audio input.
* Fix macOS occasional keyboard focus issue.
* 2MB smaller binaries.
* Fix looping sounds.
* Fix Velo to Start.
* Allow play / rec / overdub in mixer screens.
* When you load a sound with a name that already exists (case insensitive) you have the option to rename or replace. The functionality of renaming was broken, and this is now fixed.
* In TRIM screen `St:` or `End:` field didn't update if their values are the same. Fixed.
* Fixed a display bug when using Punch.
* The Change Bars screen was openable (by turning the DATA wheel on the Bars field in the MAIN screen) while playing. This is now blocked.
* Added Akai MPD16 and IK iRig PADS to bundled MIDI controller presets
* Restore the bundled MIDI control presets (currently only 3, for MPD218, MPD16 and iRig PADS) by removing them from `~/Documents/VMPC2000XL/MidiControlPresets` and restarting VMPC2000XL.
* The number pad labels have been redesigned to be more legible.
* Official Windows 7 32/64 bit support. No more need to email me for Windows 7.
* [openSUSE, Fedora, Ubuntu and Debian packages]( https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=multimedia%3Aproaudio&package=vmpc2000xl).
* Use your favorite MIDI controller with VMPC2000XL. Go to Shift + 0 for VMPC settings, set 'MIDI control mode' to 'VMPC' and press F5 to go to the MIDI tab. Use LEARN to create a controller preset. Your active preset will be auto-saved. To name and manage multiple presets, press OPEN WINDOW. Presets are stored in `~/Documents/VMPC2000XL/MidiControlPresets`. Let me know which controller you use and I'll try to add it to VMPC2000XL's bundled presets. Currently the only bundled presets are for the Akai MPD218, Akai MPD16 and iRig PADS.
* Hold Alt/Option/Ctrl while hovering over a keyboard-controllable component to see its key.
* iOS version is ready for early access. Send me an email and I'll add you to the TestFlight programme.
* Songs are now persisted correctly.
* Standalone version now has a native window border. The "Options" button for Audio/MIDI Settings has been replaced by the gear icon in the top-right.
* Resizable auxiliary LCD, for example to put on another monitor. Double-click it to open or close auxiliary display.
* Auto-converting of WAVs is enabled by default.
* Improved MIDI sync out accuracy in standalone.
* Sync to incoming MIDI clock and transmit MIDI clock are enabled by default.
* 'Master level' in 'Mixer setup' now actually affects volume.
* [macOS] Separate utility ['FAT16 Mount Blocker'](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xTA4-yKwb0oVeSN1okQbWHkYMRW-aaSg/view?usp=sharing) to prevent macOS from corrupting your MPC2000XL CF cards and other media. Just start the app, and as long as it's running in the background it will mount all FAT16 volumes as read-only. Note that if you only use up to 8 characters for your sound names, there is no corruption and hence no need for this utility. If you use up to 16 characters, you should use this utility.
