         * out events. At the moment I don't know if those MIDI events should

         * MIDI has no spec that helps us decide what that number is, nor am I
         * aware of the internals of the MPC2000XL in this area. The manual
         * states that a sequence may contain 50,000 events, and we can play
         * back 2 sequences simultaneously, but realistically it's rare that
         * someone wants to have 100,000 simultaneous MIDI note events. So we'll
         * use a nice spacious number based on intuition, which is 512.
